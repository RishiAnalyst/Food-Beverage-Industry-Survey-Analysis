## New Measures Created
Five new measures were created for use in card visuals, including:
- Total Respondents
     ```
   Total Respondents = COUNTROWS(fact_survey_responses_cleaned) 
     ```
- Total Count of Female and Male
     ```
   Female = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(fact_survey_responses_cleaned),dim_repondents[Gender]="Female")
   Male = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(fact_survey_responses_cleaned),dim_repondents[Gender]="Male")
     ```
- Percentage of Female and male Respondents.
     ```
   % male = DIVIDE([male],[Total Respondents],0)
   % female = DIVIDE([Female],[Total Respondents],0)
     ```
- 
These measures were also included in tooltips for relevant visuals.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of 11 visuals spread across 2 pages, including:
- Column Chart
- Stacked Bar Chart
- Pie Chart
- Donut Chart
- Treemap Chart
- Card Visuals

Additionally, navigation buttons and slicers were incorporated for improved interactivity and user experience.
